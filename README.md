# Simple Linear Regression

This repository contains Jupyter notebooks demonstrating simple linear regression using two popular Python libraries:
- **Statsmodels**: For detailed statistical modeling and regression analysis.
- **Scikit-learn**: For machine learning workflows and predictive modeling.

## Contents

- `SIMPLE LINEAR REGRESSION - STATMODELS.ipynb`  
  Walks through simple linear regression using the `statsmodels` library, including model fitting, summary interpretation, and diagnostic plots.

- `SIMPLE LINEAR REGRESSION-SKLEARN.ipynb`  
  Demonstrates simple linear regression using the `scikit-learn` library, including train/test splitting, fitting, prediction, and performance evaluation.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.7+
- Jupyter Notebook or JupyterLab
- Recommended: Create a virtual environment

### Installation

1. Clone this repository:
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/POOJ888/SIMPLE-LINEAR-REGRESSION.git
   cd SIMPLE-LINEAR-REGRESSION
   ```

2. Install required packages:
   ```
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
   Or install packages individually:
   ```
   pip install numpy pandas matplotlib seaborn scikit-learn statsmodels
   ```

### Running the Notebooks

1. Open Jupyter Notebook:
   ```
   jupyter notebook
   ```
2. Open either of the provided notebooks and run the cells sequentially.

## Project Structure

- **Data Loading**: Each notebook demonstrates loading or generating data for regression.
- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Visualizations and summary statistics to understand the data.
- **Model Fitting**: Step-by-step creation of simple linear regression models.
- **Evaluation and Interpretation**: Visual and quantitative evaluation of model fit and performance.

## Notes

- All code is commented and organized for educational purposes.
- If you encounter missing data errors, ensure your input files (if any) are in the expected location, or modify the data loading cell as needed.
- For reproducibility, random seeds are set where applicable.
